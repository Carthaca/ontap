You can use the `security login create` command to enable administrator accounts to access an admin or data SVM with an SSH public key.

.What you'll need

You must be a cluster administrator to perform this task.

.About this task

* You must associate the public key with the account before the account can access the SVM.
+
xref:manage-public-key-authentication-concept.adoc[Associating a public key with a user account]
+
You can perform this task before or after you enable account access.

* If you are unsure of the access control role that you want to assign to the login account, you can use the `security login modify` command to add the role later.

If you want to enable FIPS mode on your cluster, existing SSH public key accounts without the supported key algorithms must be reconfigured with a supported key type.  The accounts should be reconfigured before you enable FIPs or the administrator authentication will fail. 

The following table indicates host key type algorithms that are supported for ONTAP SSH connections.  These key types do not apply to configuring SSH public authentication.

[NOTE]
ssh-ed25519 host key algorithm support is removed in 9.11.1

.Step

. Enable local administrator accounts to access an SVM using an SSH public key:
+
`security login create -vserver _SVM_name_ -user-or-group-name user_or_group_name -application _application_ -authmethod _authentication_method_ -role _role_ -comment _comment_`
+
For complete command syntax, see the link:config-worksheets-reference.html[worksheet].
+
The following command enables the SVM administrator account `svmadmin1` with the predefined `vsadmin-volume` role to access the SVM``engData1`` using an SSH public key:
+
----
cluster1::>security login create -vserver engData1 -user-or-group-name svmadmin1 -application ssh -authmethod publickey -role vsadmin-volume
----

.After you finish

If you have not associated a public key with the administrator account, you must do so before the account can access the SVM.
