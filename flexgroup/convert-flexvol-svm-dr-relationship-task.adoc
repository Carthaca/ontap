Beginning with ONTAP 9.10.1, you can convert a FlexVol volume to a FlexGroup volume on an SVM-DR source.

.What youâ€™ll need

* The FlexVol volume that is being converted must be online.
* The operations and configurations on the FlexVol volume must be compatible with the conversion process.
+
An error message is generated if the FlexVol volume has any incompatibility, and the volume conversion is cancelled. You can take corrective actions and retry the conversion.
For more details, see xref:convert-flexvol-concept.html[Considerations for converting FlexVol volumes to FlexGroup volumes]

.Steps

. Login using advance privilege mode: `set -privilege advanced`

. From the destination, update the SVM-DR relationship:
+
`*snapmirror update -destination-path destination_svm_name: -source-path source_svm_name:*`
. Ensure that the SVM-DR relationship is in a SnapMirrored state and is not broken-off:
+
`*snapmirror show*`
. From the destination SVM, verify that the FlexVol volume is ready for conversion:
+
`*volume conversion start -vserver svm_name -volume vol_name -check-only true*`
+
If this command generates any errors other than "This is a destination SVMDR volume," you can take the appropriate corrective action, run the command again, and continue the conversion.

. From the destination, disable transfers on the SVM-DR relationship:
+
`*snapmirror quiesce -destination-path dest_svm:*`
. Start the conversion:
+
`*volume conversion start -vserver svm_name -volume vol_name*`
. Verify that the conversion is successful:
+
`*volume show vol_name -fields -volume-style-extended,state*`
+

. From the destination cluster, resume transfers for the relationship:
+
`*snapmirror resume -destination-path dest_svm:*`
. From the destination cluster, perform an update to propagate the conversion to the destination:
+
`*snapmirror update -destination-path dest_svm:*`
. Ensure that the SVM-DR relationship is in a SnapMirrored state and is not broken off:
+
`*snapmirror show*`
. Ensure the conversion occurred on the destination:
+
`*volume show vol_name -fields -volume-style-extended,state*`
