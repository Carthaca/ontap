The NetApp All SAN Arrays (ASAs) are available beginning with ONTAP 9.7.  ASAs are all-flash SAN-only solutions built on proven AFF NetApp platforms.

The ASA platforms are available in two-node switched or switchless clusters, can be configured for FC or iSCSI, and use symmetric active-active for multipathing. All paths are active/optimized so in the event of a storage failover, the host does not need to wait for the ALUA transition of the failover paths to resume I/O. This reduces time to failover.

== Set up an ASA

All SAN Arrays (ASAs) follow the same setup procedure as non-ASA systems.

System Manager guides you through the procedures necessary to initialize your cluster, create a local tier, configure protocols, and provision storage for your ASA. See the steps to xref:../software_setup/concept_decide_whether_to_use_ontap_cli.html[Configure ONTAP].

== ASA host settings and utilities

Host settings for setting up All SAN Arrays (ASAs) are the same as those for all other SAN hosts.

You can download the link:https://mysupport.netapp.com/NOW/cgi-bin/software[NetApp Host Utilities software^] for your specific hosts from the support site.

== Ways to identify an ASA system

You can identify an ASA system using System Manager or using the ONTAP command line interface (CLI).

From the System Manager dashboard, click *Cluster > Overview* and then select the system node. The *PERSONALITY* is displayed as *All SAN Array*.

From the CLI, you can use the `san config show` command. The "All SAN Array" value returns as true for ASA systems.
